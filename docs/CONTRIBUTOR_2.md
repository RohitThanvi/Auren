# Contributor 2: Provider agent

## Ownership

Provider agent, hardware scanning, resource inventory, agent protocol implementation (client side), provider-side lifecycle management.

## Files owned

- `apps/agent/**`
- Agent sections of docs describing `apps/agent` behaviour

## Not owned (request changes from the backend owner)

The agent protocol definition, API, database, `packages/contracts/**`, `docker-compose.yml`, CI, other `docs/` files.

## Current state

Development mode only: `scan` and `run` read CPU, memory, NVIDIA GPUs and storage through `HardwareProbe`/`LinuxHardwareProbe`. The agent makes no network connections and runs no workloads.

## Boundaries

- Hardware detection stays behind the `HardwareProbe` interface; add platform implementations as new modules (a Windows probe is a separate, later task).
- Privileged host operations (starting/stopping containers or VMs) must be a separate component from the unprivileged agent (ADR-0010). Do not add Docker-socket access or `sudo` calls to the agent process.
- Never expose unrestricted execution. Only typed, allow-listed operations from the backend; no shell interpolation of any backend-supplied value; fixed argv and timeouts for subprocesses.
- Buyer workloads never run directly on the provider host OS, never privileged, never with the Docker socket, always with resource limits.
- Outbound connections only, authenticated TLS; no inbound ports.
- Do not invent the wire protocol. Wait for the backend owner to publish it in `docs/`, then implement the client side and report mismatches rather than adjusting your side silently.

## Integration rules

- Configuration through `AUREN_AGENT_*` environment variables validated at startup (`config.py`); add new settings there, never hardcode limits.
- Run `make agent-check` before each PR (ruff, pyright strict, pytest with coverage) and report real results. Hardware code needs tests using fixture `/proc` files and real subprocesses (see `tests/test_linux_probe.py`).
- Logs: JSON on stderr; stdout is reserved for command output. Never log credentials.
- Update this file and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` agent section (via the architect) when behaviour changes.
